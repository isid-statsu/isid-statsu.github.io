We are also involved in teaching in various degree programs of the Institute, including M.Stat and BSDS.

The Statistical Sciences Unit of ISI Delhi was created in 2024 after a reorganization of the various 
divisions of the Institite. The initial [faculty members](people.html) in the Unit were previously part of the
